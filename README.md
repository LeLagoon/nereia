I created this pitchdeck to showcase an underwater city named "Nereia". It is a vast city with a lot of valueable things, especially its exclusive metal, "Nereium". Nereium is an extremely strong and valueable metal which can be used to make objects with extremely high tensile strength and a lot more benefits.
To invest in Nereium, I'd thought of creating a new cryptocurrency named "Nerit". Nerits can be invested in and then auctioned as well. There are also other features which are there for facilitating the exchange of Nerits or for the betterment of sailors and divers who will be getting those valueable objects.
